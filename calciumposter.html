<h2>Calcium</h2>
    <br>
<h4>You must have heard of calcium before. Calcium (Ca) is an important element that helps keep your bones and teeth healthy and strong.</h4>
    
<h4>Your nervous system also uses calcium to help transmit impulses through your body.</h4>    

<h4>Calcium is found in many rocks such as limestone, chalk and marble as well as many dairy products and vegetables.</h4>
    
<h4>Of all elements in the Earth's crust Calcium is the 5th most abundant. It makes up just over 3% of soil, air and oceans.</h4>
