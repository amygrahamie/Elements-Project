<h2>OSMIUM</h2>
    <br>
    
<h4>Osmium (Os) has an atomic number of seventy-six, and the same number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.</h4>    
<h4 class="osmiuum">Osmium is one of the densest elements in the world. It is a lustrous, bluish white, hard metal and can be brittle even at a high temperature. </h4>
    
    
<h4>Because of its density, osmium is often alloyed with other precious metals to make products such as instrument pivots, phonograph needles, and electrical contacts. It is also used in fountain pen tips.  </h4>
